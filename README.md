# Portfolio-Management-and-Optimization
This repo showcases mean-variance portfolio optimization in Python using Modern Portfolio Theory. It covers Efficient Frontier, Global Minimum Variance, and Tangency Portfolio, with simulations for risk-return analysis—ideal for those exploring quantitative finance.

🚀 Features
📊 Efficient Frontier: Visualizes portfolios offering the best return for a given risk

🧮 Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMV): Portfolio with the lowest possible risk

⚖️ Tangency Portfolio: Maximizes Sharpe Ratio with a risk-free rate

📉 Random Portfolio Simulation: Generates and analyzes risk-return profiles

📈 Risk Metrics: Uses expected returns, standard deviation, and covariance

🧰 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scipy.optimize for portfolio weights optimization
